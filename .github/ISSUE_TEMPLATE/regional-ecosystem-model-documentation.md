# Regional ecosystem model name
*Please enter the full name of your regional model.*

## Contacts
*Include the names and email addresses of the people running this regional model.*

## Spatial scale forcing
*Include the scale (e.g., global or regional) and resolution (e.g., ¼ degree or 1 degree) of your regional model runs.*

## Levels of gear disaggregation
*Describe the fishing gears used in your model, and how was the effort aggregated or disaggregated.*

## Levels of functional group disaggregation
*Describe which functional groups are used in your regional model, and how was the fishing effort allocated across groups.*

## Spatial grid-cell allocation method
*Describe how was fishing effort allocated across grid cells in your regional model. Please provide equations as well as description.*

## Fishing mortality rate equation
*Describe how fishing mortality and catch rates were calculated in your model. Please provide equations as well as description.*

## Selectivity (size, age, species)
*If you have a selectivity term please describe it. Make sure to include the equation used for this calculation.*

## Model calibration
*Catchability terms can be used to calibrate the model to catches. **Note that calibration should only include data up to 2004**. Please state how you estimated your model parameters, as well as the metrics and criteria you used to calibrate your model. Please include equations.*

## Catchability and creep (yearly rate of change catchability) estimates
*Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary.*

## Further details on calibration 
*Have you used other metrics or data in your calibration? Please include a description and equations in this section.*

## Statistical metrics
*Please provide detail on the statistical methods used in your calibration. Methods may include optimisation, error terms, etc.*

## Statistical results (summary)
*Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration. For example, RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P”B ratios, etc.*

## Model changes or improvements made as a result of calibration
*Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration.*

# Additional details 
The sections below are designed to better capture additional steps needed to run ecosystem models at a regional scale.

## Downscaling method
*Please describe further details how the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) level fishing effort was downscaled to your region. If additional data not included in ISIMIP3a workflow was used for this purpose, please provide more information about the source of this data.*

## “Base year" range of the regional model
*If effort was expressed as **"relative effort"** in your base model, please indicate the year(s) used as the reference (i.e., "base year").  Also provide a description about how relative effort was calculated.*

## Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations
*Please provide details about which climate forcing variables you used in your regional model and how these were integrated into your model. You could include information about which variables were used to represent primary/secondary producers variables, the temperature variable used (e.g., surface, bottom, integrated across depths, etc.), or any other environmental variables that you consider relevant. Ensure you provide equations for how temperature and primary/secondary producer or other variables were used in your model.*
