# Regional ecosystem model name
Cook Strait EwE

## Contacts
Tyler Eddy – tyler.eddy@mi.mun.ca

## Spatial scale forcing
Regional scale, no spatial resolution

## Levels of gear disaggregation
Pots_and_Traps; Lines_Handlines_and_poles; Gillnets; Others 
Global effort data was not used due to a correlation with fishing effort of less than 0.5

## Levels of functional group disaggregation
lobsterscrab (Pots_and_Traps); demersal30-90cm (Lines_Handlines_and_poles; Gillnets); demersalmollusc (Others)  

## Spatial grid-cell allocation method
Non spatial model

## Fishing mortality rate equation
Fishing mortality was provided by the New Zealand fisheries science and management department

## Selectivity (size, age, species)
n/a

## Model calibration
Model was driven with time series of fishing morality and modelled functional group biomasses were calibrated to observed functional group biomasses

## Catchability and creep (yearly rate of change catchability) estimates
n/a, fishing mortality is used

## Further details on calibration 
*Have you used other metrics or data in your calibration? Please include a description and equations in this section.*

## Statistical metrics
n/a

## Statistical results (summary)
Comparison of modelled biomass to observed biomass to produce best correlation coefficient

## Model changes or improvements made as a result of calibration
n/a

# Additional details 
The sections below are designed to better capture additional steps needed to run ecosystem models at a regional scale.

## Downscaling method
Due to the global fishing effort data having a correlation with regional fishing effort data of less than 0.5, global effort data was not used

## “Base year" range of the regional model
1945

## Environmental and biogeochemical variables and equations
intpp was applied using the delta method as a forcing function to modify primary production in EwE, similar to 2b and 3b simulation rounds
